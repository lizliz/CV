            "abstract": "Changes in the parameters of dynamical systems can cause the state of the system to shift between different qualitative regimes. These shifts, known as bifurcations, are critical to study as they can indicate when the system is about to undergo harmful changes in its behaviour. In stochastic dynamical systems, particular interest is in P-type (phenomenological) bifurcations, which can include transitions from a mono-stable state to multi-stable states, the appearance of stochastic limit cycles, and other features in the probability distributions of the system's state space. Currently, the common practice is to visually analyze the probability density function to determine the type of state, but this approach is limited to experienced users, systems with small state spaces and mandate human intervention. In contrast, this study presents a new approach based on Topological Data Analysis (TDA) that uses the superlevel persistence of the probability or kernel density function to mathematically quantify P-type bifurcations in stochastic systems using the ranks of $0^th$ and $1^st$ homology groups.",

The United States is the second largest producer, accounting for 25\\% of the total global supply. Nonetheless, producers face an ever-growing demand in a more uncertain climate landscape, which requires effective and efficient walnut selection and breeding of new cultivars with increased kernel content and easy-to-open shells. Past and current efforts select for these traits using hand-held calipers and eye-based evaluations. Yet there is plenty of morphology that meets the eye but goes unmeasured, such as the volume of inner air or the convexity of the kernel. Here, we study the shape of walnut fruits based on X-ray computed tomography three-dimensional reconstructions. We compute 49 different morphological phenotypes for 1264 individual nuts comprising 149 accessions. These phenotypes are complemented by traits of breeding interest such as ease of kernel removal and kernel-to-nut weight ratio. Through allometric relationships, relative growth of one tissue to another, we identify possible biophysical constraints at play during development. We explore multiple correlations between all morphological and commercial traits and identify which morphological traits can explain the most variability of commercial traits. We show that using only volume- and thickness-based traits, especially inner air content, we can successfully encode several of the commercial traits.",

The resulting approach is general and applicable to a wide variety of time-varying graphs. For example, these graphs may correspond to a system modeled as a network with edges whose weights are functions of time, or they may represent a time series of a complex dynamical system. We use simplicial complexes to represent snapshots of the temporal networks that can then be analyzed using zigzag persistence. We show two applications of our method to dynamic networks: an analysis of commuting trends on multiple temporal scales, e.g., daily and weekly, in the Great Britain transportation network, and the detection of periodic/chaotic transitions due to intermittency in dynamical systems represented by temporal ordinal partition networks. Our findings show that the resulting zero- and one-dimensional zigzag persistence diagrams can detect changes in the networks' shapes that are missed by traditional connectivity and centrality graph statistics.",

A fundamental problem in this type of data is comparison: given a set of such graphs, can we rank how similar they are, in such a way that we capture their geometric \"shape\" in the plane? In this paper we explore a method to compare two such embedded graphs, via a simplified combinatorial representation called a tail-less merge tree which encodes the structure based on a fixed direction. First, we examine the properties of a distance designed to compare merge trees called the branching distance, and show that the distance as defined in previous work fails to satisfy some of the requirements of a metric. We incorporate this into a new distance function called average branching distance to compare graphs by looking at the branching distance for merge trees defined over many directions. Despite the theoretical issues, we show that the definition is still quite useful in practice by using our open-source code to cluster data sets of embedded graphs.",

That is, given a collection of time series over a varying parameter, when has the structure of the underlying dynamical system changed? For this task, we turn to the field of topological data analysis (TDA), which encodes information about the shape and structure of data. The idea of utilizing tools from TDA for signal processing tasks, known as topological signal processing (TSP), has gained much attention in recent years, largely through a standard pipeline that computes the persistent homology of the point cloud generated by the Takens' embedding. However, this procedure is limited by computation time since the simplicial complex generated in this case is large, but also has a great deal of redundant data. For this reason, we turn to a more recent method for encoding the structure of the attractor, which constructs an ordinal partition network (OPN) representing information about when the dynamical system has passed between certain regions of state space. The result is a weighted graph whose structure encodes information about the underlying attractor. Our previous work began to find ways to package the information of the OPN in a manner that is amenable to TDA; however, that work only used the network structure and did nothing to encode the additional weighting information. In this paper, we take the next step: building a pipeline to analyze the weighted OPN with TDA and showing that this framework provides more resilience to noise or perturbations in the system and improves the accuracy of the dynamic state detection.",

Transitional networks are formed from time series data and they leverage graph theory tools to reveal information about the underlying dynamic system. However, traditional tools can fail to summarize the complex topology present in such graphs. In this work, we leverage persistent homology from topological data analysis to study the structure of these networks. We contrast dynamic state detection from time series using CGSSN and TDA to two state of the art approaches: Ordinal Partition Networks (OPNs) combined with TDA, and the standard application of persistent homology to the time-delay embedding of the signal. We show that the CGSSN captures rich information about the dynamic state of the underlying dynamical system as evidenced by a significant improvement in dynamic state detection and noise robustness in comparison to OPNs. We also show that because the computational time of CGSSN is not linearly dependent on the signal's length, it is more computationally efficient than applying TDA to the time-delay embedding of the time series.",

We tested this framework using computational models of collective oscillations and calcium signaling in the Drosophila wing imaginal disc, as well as experimental data, including in vitro ERK signaling in human mammary epithelial cells and in vivo calcium signaling from the mouse epidermis and visual cortex. We found that the geometry and topology of the trajectory are related to the degree of synchrony (over space and time), intensity, speed, and quasi-periodicity of the signaling pattern. We recovered model parameters and experimental conditions by training neural networks on trajectory data, showing that our approach preserves information that characterizes various cell types, tissues and drug treatments.

The proposed simplicial coarsening scheme is built upon partitions of vertices, which allow us to generate hierarchical representations of simplicial complexes, collapsing information in a learned fashion. NervePool builds on the learned vertex cluster assignments and extends to coarsening of higher dimensional simplices in a deterministic fashion.

            "abstract": "Since they emerged ~125 million years ago, flowering plants have evolved to dominate the terrestrial landscape and survive in the most inhospitable environments on earth. At their core, these adaptations have been shaped by changes in numerous, interconnected pathways and genes that collectively give rise to emergent biological phenomena. Linking gene expression to morphological outcomes remains a grand challenge in biology, and new approaches are needed to begin to address this gap. Here, we implemented topological data analysis (TDA) to summarize the high dimensionality and noisiness of gene expression data using lens functions that delineate plant tissue and stress responses. Using this framework, we created a topological representation of the shape of gene expression across plant evolution, development, and environment for the phylogenetically diverse flowering plants. The TDA-based Mapper graphs form a well-defined gradient of tissues from leaves to seeds, or from healthy to stressed samples, depending on the lens function. This suggests there are distinct and conserved expression patterns across angiosperms that delineate different tissue types or responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. Genes that correlate with the tissue lens function are enriched in central processes such as photosynthetic, growth and development, housekeeping, or stress responses. Together, our results highlight the power of TDA for analyzing complex biological data and reveal a core expression backbone that defines plant form and function.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.",

            "abstract": "The selection of Arabidopsis as a model organism played a pivotal role in advancing genomic science, firmly establishing the cornerstone of modern plant molecular biology. Competing frameworks to select an agricultural- or ecological-based model species, or to decentralize plant science and study a multitude of diverse species, were selected against in favor of building core knowledge in a species that would facilitate genome-enabled research that could assumedly be transferred to other plants. Here, over twenty years after sequencing the Arabidopsis genome and during which time sequencing data from other plant species has accumulated and computation enabling machine learning has evolved, we critically examine the ability of models based on Arabidopsis gene expression data to predict tissue identity in other flowering plant species. Comparing different machine learning algorithms, models trained and tested on Arabidopsis data achieved precision and recall values of up to 0.99 using the K-Nearest Neighbor method, whereas when tissue identity is predicted across the flowering plants using models trained on Arabidopsis data, precision values range from 0.70 to 0.75 and recall from 0.55 to 0.64, depending on the algorithm used. Below-ground tissue is more predictable than other tissue types, and the ability to predict tissue identity is not correlated with phylogenetic distance from Arabidopsis. Our data-driven results suggest that, in hindsight, the assertion that knowledge from Arabidopsis is translatable to other plants is not as strong as originally assumed, and that in the current era where sequencing data and computation abound, we should decentralize the scientific focus on Arabidopsis and embrace plant diversity.",

The ability to compare and cluster such objects is required in a data analysis pipeline, leading to a need for distances or metrics on these objects. In this work, we study the interleaving distance on geometric graphs, where functor representations of data can be compared by finding pairs of natural transformations between them. However, in many cases, particularly those of the set-valued functor variety, computation of the interleaving distance is NP-hard. For this reason, we take inspiration from the work of Robinson to find quality measures for families of maps that do not rise to the level of a natural transformation. Specifically, we call collections $\\phi = \\\\phi_U\\mid U\\$ and $\\psi = \\\\psi_U\\mid U\\$ which do not necessarily form a true interleaving an \\textitassignment. In the case of embedded graphs, we impose a grid structure on the plane, treat this as a poset endowed with the Alexandroff topology $K$, and encode the embedded graph data as functors $F: \\mathbfOpen(K) \\to \\mathbfSet$ where $F(U)$ is the set of connected components of the graph inside of the geometric realization of the set $U$. We then endow the image with the extra structure of a metric space and define a loss function $L(\\phi,\\psi)$ which measures how far the required diagrams of an interleaving are from commuting. Then for a pair of assignments, we use this loss function to bound the interleaving distance, with an eye toward computation and approximation of the distance. We expect these ideas are not only useful in our particular use case of embedded graphs, but can be extended to a larger class of interleaving distance problems where computational complexity creates a barrier to use in practice.",

The vertices of a Reeb graph are associated with a real-valued level. In the context of topological data analysis, the level of a vertex usually corresponds to some imprecise measured quantity. Due to this imprecision, nearby points in a Reeb graph may represent the same point in\nthe ground-truth.\n\nWe consider drawings of Reeb graphs in the plane, where the y-coordinate of a vertex is specified by its level, and edges are drawn as y-monotone paths. We introduce the crossing radius as a quality measure for Reeb graph drawings. Under this measure, level-planar drawings of Reeb graphs are optimal if they exist. In this regard, our measure coincides with existing quality measures that simply count the number of crossings. On the other hand, most Reeb graphs found in practice do not admit level-planar drawings. In contrast to measures that count the number of crossings, our measure associates a cost with each crossing, and returns the maximum cost over all crossings. The cost of a crossing intuitively quantifies the likelihood that the necessity of a crossing can be attributed to imprecise measurements. For this reason, crossing radius is a preferable measure in the context of topological data analysis. We also show that for a given Reeb graph, computing a drawing with optimal crossing radius is NP-hard.",

            "abstract": "The persistence diagram is an increasingly useful tool arising from the field of Topological Data Analysis. However, using these diagrams in conjunction with machine learning techniques requires some mathematical finesse. The most success to date has come from finding methods for turning persistence diagrams into vectors in $\\mathbbR^n$ in a way which preserves as much of the space of persistence diagrams as possible, commonly referred to as featurization. In this paper, we describe a mathematical framework for featurizing the persistence diagram space using template functions. These functions are general as they are only required to be continuous, have a compact support, and separate points. We discuss two example realizations of these functions: tent functions and Chybeyshev interpolating polynomials. Both of these functions are defined on a grid superposed on the birth-lifetime plane. We then combine the resulting features with machine learning algorithms to perform supervised classification and regression on several example data sets, including manifold data, shape data, and an embedded time series from a Rossler system. Our results show that the template function approach yields high accuracy rates that match and often exceed the results of existing methods for featurizing persistence diagrams. One counter-intuitive observation is that in most cases using interpolating polynomials, where each point contributes globally to the feature vector, yields significantly better results than using tent functions, where the contribution of each point is localized to its grid cell. Along the way, we also provide a complete characterization of compact sets in persistence diagram space endowed with the bottleneck distance.",

Therefore, we describe an alternative method based on persistent homology -- a tool from Topological Data Analysis (TDA) -- that utilizes Betti numbers and CROCKER plots. Betti numbers are topological invariants of topological spaces, while the CROCKER plot is a coarsened but easy to visualize data representation of a one-parameter varying family of persistence barcodes. The specific bifurcations we investigate are transitions from periodic to chaotic behavior or vice versa in a one-parameter family of differential equations. We validate our methods using numerical experiments on ten dynamical systems and contrast the results with existing tools that use the maximum Lyapunov exponent. We further prove the relationship between the Wasserstein distance to the empty diagram and the norm of the Betti vector, which shows that an even more simplified version of the information has the potential to provide insight into the bifurcation parameter. The results show that our approach reveals more information about the shape of the periodic attractor than standard tools, and it has more favorable computational time in comparison to the Rosenstein algorithm for computing the Lyapunov exponent from time series.",

Citrus oil glands in particular contain essential oils which include plant secondary metabolites associated with flavor and aroma. Capturing and analyzing nuanced information behind the citrus fruit shape and its oil gland distribution provide a morphology-driven path to further our insight into phenotype\u2013genotype interactions.\n\nWe investigated the shape of citrus fruit of 51 accessions based on 3D X-ray computed tomography (CT) scan reconstructions. Accessions include members of the three ancestral citrus species as well as related genera, and several interspecific hybrids. We digitally separate and compare the size of fruit endocarp, mesocarp, exocarp, and oil gland tissue. Based on the centers of the oil glands, overall fruit shape is approximated with an ellipsoid. Possible oil gland distributions on this ellipsoid surface are explored using directional statistics.\n\nThere is a strong allometry along fruit tissues; that is, we observe a strong linear relationship between the logarithmic volume of any pair of major tissues. This suggests that the relative growth of fruit tissues with respect to each other follows a power law. We also observe that on average, glands distance themselves from their nearest neighbor following a square root relationship, which suggests normal diffusion dynamics at play.\n\nThe observed allometry and square root models point to the existence of biophysical developmental constraints that govern novel relationships between fruit dimensions from both evolutionary and breeding perspectives. Understanding these biophysical interactions prompts an exciting research path on fruit development and breeding.",

We first give a categorification of the mapper graph and the Reeb graph by interpreting them in terms of cosheaves and stratified covers of the real line $\\mathbbR$. We then introduce a variant of the classic mapper graph of Singh et al., referred to as the enhanced mapper graph, and demonstrate that such a construction approximates the Reeb graph of $(\\mathbbX, f)$ when it is applied to points randomly sampled from a probability density function concentrated on $(\\mathbbX, f)$. Our techniques are based on the interleaving distance of constructible cosheaves and topological estimation via kernel density estimates. Following Munch and Wang, we first show that the mapper graph of $(\\mathbbX, f)$, a constructible $\\mathbbR$-space (with a fixed open cover), approximates the Reeb graph of the same space. We then construct an isomorphism between the mapper of $(\\mathbbX, f)$ to the mapper of a super-level set of a probability density function concentrated on $(\\mathbbX, f)$. Finally, building on the approach of Bobrowski et al., we show that, with high probability, we can recover the mapper of the super-level set given a sufficiently large sample. Our work is the first to consider the mapper construction using the theory of cosheaves in a probabilistic setting. It is part of an ongoing effort to combine sheaf theory, probability, and statistics, to support topological data analysis with random data.",

Intuitively, we \"chop off\" parts near local minima and maxima during the course of smoothing, where the amount cut is controlled by a parameter $\\tau$. After formalizing truncation as a functor, we show that when applied after the smoothing functor, this prevents extensive expansion of the range of the function, and yields particularly nice properties (such as maintaining connectivity) when combined with smoothing for $0 \\leq \\tau \\leq 2\\varepsilon$, where $\\varepsilon$ is the smoothing parameter. Then, for the restriction of $\\tau \\in [0,\\varepsilon]$, we have additional structure which we can take advantage of to construct a categorical flow for any choice of slope $m \\in [0,1]$. Using the infrastructure built for a category with a flow, this then gives an interleaving distance for every $m \\in [0,1]$, which is a generalization of the original interleaving distance, which is the case $m=0$. While the resulting metrics are not stable, we show that any pair of these for $m,m' \\in [0,1)$ are strongly equivalent metrics, which in turn gives stability of each metric up to a multiplicative constant. We conclude by discussing implications of this metric within the broader family of metrics for Reeb graphs.",

Traditional phenotypic analysis methods measure some features but fail to measure the information embedded in shape comprehensively. To extract, compare and analyse this information embedded in a robust and concise way, we turn to topological data analysis (TDA), specifically the Euler characteristic transform. TDA measures shape comprehensively using mathematical representations based on algebraic topology features. To study its use, we compute both traditional and topological shape descriptors to quantify the morphology of 3121 barley seeds scanned with X-ray computed tomography (CT) technology at 127 \u03bcm resolution. The Euler characteristic transform measures shape by analysing topological features of an object at thresholds across a number of directional axes. A Kruskal\u2013Wallis analysis of the information encoded by the topological signature reveals that the Euler characteristic transform picks up successfully the shape of the crease and bottom of the seeds. Moreover, while traditional shape descriptors can cluster the seeds based on their accession, topological shape descriptors can cluster them further based on their panicle. We then successfully train a support vector machine to classify 28 different accessions of barley based exclusively on the shape of their grains. We observe that combining both traditional and topological descriptors classifies barley seeds better than using just traditional descriptors alone. This improvement suggests that TDA is thus a powerful complement to traditional morphometrics to comprehensively describe a multitude of \u2018hidden\u2019 shape nuances which are otherwise not detected.",

Further, they are closely related to extended persistence diagrams, which largely but not completely encode the information of the Reeb graph. In this paper, we investigate the effect on the persistence diagram of a particular continuous operation on Reeb graphs; namely the (truncated) smoothing operation. This construction arises in the context of the Reeb graph interleaving distance, but separately from that viewpoint provides a simplification of the Reeb graph which continuously shrinks small loops. We then use this characterization to initiate the study of inverse problems for Reeb graphs using smoothing by showing which paths in persistence diagram space (commonly known as vineyards) can be realized by a path in the space of Reeb graphs via these simple operations. This allows us to solve the inverse problem on a certain family of piecewise linear vineyards when fixing an initial Reeb graph.",

The diurnal pattern can be seen in infrared (IR) satellite imagery as cyclical pulses in the cloud field that propagate radially outward from the center of nearly all Atlantic-basin TCs. These diurnal pulses, a distinguishing characteristic of the TC diurnal cycle, begin forming in the storm's inner core near sunset each day and appear as a region of cooling cloud-top temperatures. The area of cooling takes on a ring-like appearance as cloud-top warming occurs on its inside edge and the cooling moves away from the storm overnight, reaching several hundred kilometers from the circulation center by the following afternoon. The state-of-the-art TC diurnal cycle measurement has a limited ability to analyze the behavior beyond qualitative observations. We present a method for quantifying the TC diurnal cycle using one-dimensional persistent homology, a tool from Topological Data Analysis, by tracking maximum persistence and quantifying the cycle using the discrete Fourier transform. Using Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite IR imagery data from Hurricane Felix (2007), our method is able to detect an approximate daily cycle.",

Here, we review applications of topological data analysis (TDA) to biology in a way accessible to biologists and applied mathematicians alike. TDA uses principles from algebraic topology to comprehensively measure shape in data sets. Using a function that relates the similarity of data points to each other, we can monitor the evolution of topological features\u2014connected components, loops, and voids. This evolution, a topological signature, concisely summarizes large, complex data sets. We first provide a TDA primer for biologists before exploring the use of TDA across biological sub\u2010disciplines, spanning structural biology, molecular biology, evolution, and development. We end by comparing and contrasting different TDA approaches and the potential for their use in biology.

Most topological models are designed for the global topology of a given object as a whole. There is no method reported in the literature for the topology of an individual component in an object to the best of our knowledge. For many problems in science and engineering, the topology of an individual component is important for describing its properties. We propose evolutionary homology (EH) constructed via a time evolution-based filtration and topological persistence. Our approach couples a set of dynamical systems or chaotic oscillators by the interactions of a physical system, such as a macromolecule. The interactions are approximated by weighted graph Laplacians. Simplices, simplicial complexes, algebraic groups and topological persistence are defined on the coupled trajectories of the chaotic oscillators. The resulting EH gives rise to time-dependent topological invariants or evolutionary barcodes for an individual component of the physical system, revealing its topology-function relationship. In conjunction with Wasserstein metrics, the proposed EH is applied to protein flexibility analysis, an important problem in computational biophysics. Numerical results for the B-factor prediction of a benchmark set of 364 proteins indicate that the proposed EH outperforms all the other state-of-the-art methods in the field.",

Existing theories require that such a poset have a superlinear family of translations or a similar structure. However, many posets of interest to topological data analysis, such as zig-zag posets and the face relation poset of a cell-complex, do not admit interesting translations, and consequently don't admit a nice theory of interleavings. In this paper we show how one can side-step this limitation by providing a general theory where one maps to a poset that does admit interesting translations, such as the lattice of down sets, and then defines interleavings relative to this map. Part of our theory includes a rigorous notion of discretization or \"pixelization\" of poset modules, which in turn we use for interleaving inference. We provide an approximation condition that in the setting of lattices gives rise to two possible pixelizations, both of which are guaranteed to be close in the interleaving distance.

Dormant epicormic buds remain on the surface of trees, pushed outward from the pith during secondary growth, but maintaining vascular connections. Epicormic buds can be reactivated, either through natural processes or intentionally, to rejuvenate orchards and control tree architecture. Because epicormic structures are embedded within secondary growth, tomographic approaches are a useful method to study them and understand their development. We apply techniques from image processing to determine the locations of epicormic vascular traces embedded within secondary growth of sweet cherry (Prunus avium L.), revealing the juvenile phyllotactic pattern in the trunk of an adult tree. Techniques include breadth-first search to find the pith of the tree, edge detection to approximate the radius, and a conversion to polar coordinates to threshold and segment phyllotactic features. Intensity values from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the trunk are projected onto the surface of a perfect cylinder to find the locations of traces in the \"boundary image\". Mathematical phyllotaxy provides a means to capture the patterns in the boundary image by modeling phyllotactic parameters. Our cherry tree specimen has the conspicuous parastichy pair $(2,3)$, phyllotactic fraction 2/5, and divergence angle of approximately 143 degrees. The methods described not only provide a framework to study phyllotaxy, but for image processing of volumetric image data in plants. Our results have practical implications for orchard rejuvenation and directed approaches to influence tree architecture. The study of epicormic structures, which are hidden within secondary growth, using tomographic methods also opens the possibility of studying the genetic and environmental basis of such structures.",

In this paper, we focus on one such metric, the $\\ell^\\infty$-cophenetic metric introduced by Cardona et al. This metric works by representing a phylogenetic tree with $n$ labeled leaves as a point in  $\\mathbbR^n(n+1)/2$  known as the cophenetic vector, then comparing the two resulting Euclidean points using the $\\ell^\\infty$ distance. Meanwhile, the interleaving distance is a formal categorical construction generalized from the definition of Chazal et al., originally introduced to compare persistence modules arising from the field of topological data analysis. We show that the $\\ell^\\infty$-cophenetic metric is an example of an interleaving distance. To do this, we define phylogenetic trees as a category of merge trees with some additional structure, namely, labelings on the leaves plus a requirement that morphisms respect these labels. Then we can use the definition of a flow on this category to give an interleaving distance. Finally, we show that, because of the additional structure given by the categories defined, the map sending a labeled merge tree to the cophenetic vector is, in fact, an isometric embedding, thus proving that the $\\ell^\\infty$-cophenetic metric is an interleaving distance.",

In scalar field topology, graph-based topological descriptors such as merge trees, contour trees, and Reeb graphs are commonly used to characterize topological changes in the (sub)level sets of scalar fields. One of the biggest challenges and opportunities to advance topology-based visualization is to understand and incorporate uncertainty into such topological descriptors to effectively reason about their underlying data. In this paper, we study a structural average of a set of labeled merge trees and use it to encode uncertainty in data. Specifically, we compute a 1-center tree that minimizes its maximum distance to any other tree in the set under a well-defined metric called the interleaving distance. We provide heuristic strategies that compute structural averages of merge trees whose labels do not fully agree. We further provide an interactive visualization system that resembles a numerical calculator that takes as input a set of merge trees and outputs a tree as their structural average. We also highlight structural similarities between the input and the average and incorporate uncertainty information for visual exploration. We develop a novel measure of uncertainty, referred to as consistency, via a metric-space view of the input trees. Finally, we demonstrate an application of our framework through merge trees that arise from ensembles of scalar fields. Our work is the first to employ interleaving distances and consistency to study a global, mathematically rigorous, structural average of merge trees in the context of uncertainty visualization.",

In this study, we use topological features of data simulating cutting tool vibrations, combined with four supervised machine learning algorithms to diagnose chatter in the milling process. Persistence diagrams, a method of representing topological features, are not easily used in the context of machine learning, so they must be transformed into a form that is more amenable. Specifically, we will focus on two different methods for featurizing persistence diagrams, Carlsson coordinates and template functions. In this paper, we provide classification results for simulated data from various cutting configurations, including upmilling and downmilling, in addition to the same data with some added noise. Our results show that Carlsson Coordinates and Template Functions yield accuracies as high as 96% and 95%, respectively.

Specifically, we show how persistent homology, a tool from TDA, can be used to yield a compressed, multi-scale representation of the graph that can distinguish between dynamic states such as periodic and chaotic behavior. We show the approach for two graph constructions obtained from the time series. In the first approach the time series is embedded into a point cloud which is then used to construct an undirected $k$-nearest neighbor graph. The second construct relies on the recently developed ordinal partition framework. In either case, a pairwise distance matrix is then calculated using the shortest path between the graph's nodes, and this matrix is utilized to define a filtration of a simplicial complex that enables tracking the changes in homology classes over the course of the filtration. These changes are summarized in a persistence diagram---a two-dimensional summary of changes in the topological features. We then extract existing as well as new geometric and entropy point summaries from the persistence diagram and compare to other commonly used network characteristics. Our results show that persistence-based point summaries yield a clearer distinction of the dynamic behavior and are more robust to noise than existing graph-based scores, especially when combined with ordinal graphs.",

            "abstract": "Chatter identification and detection in machining processes has been an active area of research in the past two decades. Part of the challenge in studying chatter is that machining equations that describe its occurrence are often nonlinear delay differential equations. The majority of the available tools for chatter identification rely on defining a metric that captures the characteristics of chatter, and a threshold that signals its occurrence. The difficulty in choosing these parameters can be somewhat alleviated by utilizing machine learning techniques. However, even with a successful classification algorithm, the transferability of typical machine learning methods from one data set to another remains very limited. In this paper we combine supervised machine learning with Topological Data Analysis (TDA) to obtain a descriptor of the process which can detect chatter. The features we use are derived from the persistence diagram of an attractor reconstructed from the time series via Takens embedding. We test the approach using deterministic and stochastic turning models, where the stochasticity is introduced via the cutting coefficient term. Our results show a 97% successful classification rate on the deterministic model labeled by the stability diagram obtained using the spectral element method. The features gleaned from the deterministic model are then utilized for characterization of chatter in a stochastic turning model where there are very limited analysis methods.",

The signal is a two-state square wave with randomly varying in-between-pulse spacing, subject to spurious steps at the rising or falling edges which we call digital ringing. We use persistent homology to derive mathematical guarantees for the resulting change detection which enables accurate identification and counting of the true pulses. The approach is tested using both synthetic and experimental data obtained using an engine lathe instrumented with a laser tachometer. The described algorithm enables accurate and automatic calculations of the spindle speed without any choice of parameters. The results are compared with the frequency and sequency methods of the Fourier and Walsh\u2013Hadamard transforms, respectively. Both our approach and the Fourier analysis yield comparable results for pulses with regular spacing and digital ringing while the latter causes large errors using the Walsh\u2013Hadamard method. Further, the described approach significantly outperforms the frequency/sequency analyses when the spacing between the peaks is varied. We discuss generalizing the approach to higher dimensional PWC signals, although using this extension remains an interesting question for future research.",

            "abstract": "The interleaving distance was originally defined in the field of Topological Data Analysis (TDA) by Chazal et al. as a metric on the class of persistence modules parametrized over the real line. Bubenik et al. subsequently extended the definition to categories of functors on a poset, the objects in these categories being regarded as `generalized persistence modules'. These metrics typically depend on the choice of a lax semigroup of endomorphisms of the poset. The purpose of the present paper is to develop a more general framework for the notion of interleaving distance using the theory of `actegories'. Specifically, we extend the notion of interleaving distance to arbitrary categories equipped with a flow, i.e. a lax monoidal action by the monoid $[0,\\infty)$. In this way, the class of objects in such a category acquires the structure of a Lawvere metric space. Functors that are colax $[0,\\infty)$-equivariant yield maps that are 1-Lipschitz. This leads to concise proofs of various known stability results from TDA, by considering appropriate colax $[0,\\infty)$-equivariant functors. Along the way, we show that several common metrics, including the Hausdorff distance and the $L^\\infty$-norm, can be realized as interleaving distances in this general perspective.",

What makes them even more useful in practice is that they come with a notion of a metric, the Wasserstein distance (closely related to but not the same as the homonymous metric from probability theory). Further, this metric provides a notion of stability; that is, small noise in the input causes at worst small differences in the output. In this paper, we show that the Wasserstein distance for persistence diagrams can be computed through quantum annealing. We provide a formulation of the problem as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization problem, or QUBO, and prove correctness. Finally, we test our algorithm, exploring parameter choices and problem size capabilities, using a D-Wave 2000Q quantum annealing computer.",

The approach is illustrated utilizing two stochastic delay equations. The first model equation is the stochastic version of Hayes equation--a scalar autonomous delay equation--where the noise is an additive term. The second model equation is the stochastic version of Mathieu\u2019s equation--a time-periodic delay equation. In the latter, noise is added via a multiplicative term in the time-periodic coefficient. The time series is generated using Euler\u2013Maruyama method and a corresponding point cloud is obtained using the Takens\u2019 embedding. The point cloud is then analyzed using a tool from TDA known as persistent homology. The results of this study show that the described approach can be used for analyzing datasets of delay dynamical systems that are described using constant as well as time-periodic coefficients. The presented approach can be used for signals generated from both\nnumerical simulation and experiments. It can be used as a tool to study the stability of stochastic delay equations for which there are currently a limited number of analysis tools.",

This is done by representing some aspect of the structure of the data in a simplified topological signature. In this article, we introduce two of the most commonly used topological signatures. First, the persistence diagram represents loops and holes in the space by considering connectivity of the data points for a continuum of values rather than a single fixed value. The second topological signature, the mapper graph, returns a 1-dimensional structure representing the shape of the data, and is particularly good for exploration and visualization of the data. While these techniques are based on very sophisticated mathematics, the current ubiquity of available software means that these tools are more accessible than ever to be applied to data by researchers in education and learning, as well as all domain scientists.",

Using this equivalency, we can define an `interleaving' distance between Reeb graphs which is stable under the perturbation of a function.

First introduced by Edelsbrunner et al. (Edelsbrunner et al. 2008), it compresses the components of the level sets of a multivariate mapping and obtains a summary representation of their relationships. A related construction called the mapper (Singh et al. 2007), and a special case of mapper called the Joint Contour Net (Carr et al. 2014) have been shown to be effective in visual analytics. Mapper and JCN are intuitively regarded as discrete approximations of the Reeb space, however without formal proofs or approximation guarantees. An open question has been proposed by Dey et al. (Dey et al. 2015) as to whether the mapper converges to the Reeb space in the limit. \nIn this paper, we are interested in developing the theoretical understanding of the relationship between the Reeb space and its discrete approximations to support its use in practical data analysis. Using tools from category theory, we formally prove the convergence between the Reeb space and mapper in terms of an interleaving distance between their categorical representations. Given a sequence of refined discretizations, we prove that these approximations converge to the Reeb space in the interleaving distance; this also helps to quantify the approximation quality of the discretization at a fixed resolution.",

In particular, they showed that the Fr\u00e9chet mean of a finite set of diagrams always exists, but is not necessarily unique. The means of a continuously-varying\nset of diagrams do not themselves (necessarily) vary continuously, which presents obvious problems when trying to extend the Fr&eacute;chet mean definition to the realm of time-varying persistence diagrams, better known as vineyards.\n\nWe fix this problem by altering the original definition of Fr&eacute;chet mean so that it now becomes a probability measure on the set of persistence diagrams; in a nutshell, the mean of a set of diagrams will be a weighted sum of atomic measures, where each atom is itself a persistence diagram determined using a perturbation of the input diagrams. This definition gives for each N a map $(D _p )^N \\rightarrow P(D_ p )$. We show that this map is Hoelder continuous on finite diagrams and thus can be used to build a useful statistic on vineyards.",

            "abstract": "This paper explores the possibility of using techniques from topological data analysis for studying datasets generated from dynamical systems described by stochastic delay equations. The dataset is generated using Euler-Maryuama simulation for two first order systems with stochastic parameters drawn from a normal distribution. The first system contains additive noise whereas the second one contains parametric or multiplicative noise. Using Taken's embedding, the dataset is converted into a point cloud in a high-dimensional space. Persistent homology is then employed to analyze the structure of the point cloud in order to study equilibria and periodic solutions of the underlying system. Our results show that the persistent homology successfully differentiates between different types of equilibria. Therefore, we believe this approach will prove useful for automatic data analysis of vibration measurements. For example, our approach can be used in machining processes for chatter detection and prevention.",

We use a nonlinear model that describes the tool oscillations due to self-excited vibrations in turning. The time series is generated using Euler-Maruyama method and then is turned into a point cloud in a high dimensional Euclidean space using the delay embedding. The point cloud can then be analyzed using persistent homology. Specifically, in the deterministic case, the system has a stable fixed point while the loss of stability is associated with Hopf bifurcation whereby a limit cycle branches from the fixed point. Since periodicity in the signal translates into circularity in the point cloud, the persistence diagram associated to the periodic time series will have a high persistence point. This can be used to determine a threshold criteria that can automatically classify the system behavior based on its time series. The results of this study show that the described approach can be used for analyzing datasets of delay dynamical systems generated both from numerical simulation and experimental data.",

We seek to compute the probability that a set of sensors fails to cover given only non-metric, local (who is talking to whom) information and a probability distribution of failure of each node. This builds on the work of de Silva and Ghrist who analyzed this problem in the deterministic situation. We first show that it is part of a slightly larger class of problems which is #P-hard, and thus fast algorithms likely do not exist unless P $=$ NP. The question of whether the specific problem is, in fact, #P-hard remains open. We then give a deterministic algorithm which is feasible in the case of a small set of sensors, and give a dynamic algorithm for an arbitrary set of sensors failing over time which utilizes a new criterion for coverage to give an early warning of potential failure. These algorithms build on the theory of topological persistence.",
