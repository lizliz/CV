# CV

This folder includes Liz Munch's files for generating her CV.  It's relatively file-directory specific so apologies, you might need to modify the content to your particular needs. 

The main things to find in here are:

- `LizCV-EDIT-ME.tex` which is the main tex file that I actually edit. 
- `WebsiteToCV.py` which is they python code I run from the `CompileCV`folder to generate teh finished product. 
- `GeneratePublicationJSON.py` which converts from the bib file with my publication list into the json I use [for my website](http://elizabethmunch.com/research)
- `MyPublications.bib` which is where I track my publications and they get auto included into the CV.
- `talks.json` where I track talks I give and they also get automatically included into the CV
- `teaching.json` same as above.
